## Local Working Environment

1. Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/).
   - Most users should simply use the [self&#8209;contained Hugo executable for their platform](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases). Linux package managers often provide old versions of Hugo.
1. Clone this repository: `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/FutureNursing-at/futurenursing.at`.
1. Run `hugo serve` to start the local development server at (by default) `http://localhost:1313`.
   - Alternatively run `hugo` to simply build the site into the `public/` directory.

To install PaperMod just visit [PaperMod's wiki](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod/wiki/Installation).
